# React Native TypeScript App Documentation

## Running the App

To run the app with `npm start`:

1. **Open a terminal or command prompt** and navigate to the root directory of your React Native app.
2. **Install dependencies**: If you haven't already, install the necessary dependencies by running the command:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the app**: Once the dependencies are installed, start the app by running:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. This will start the Metro bundler and launch the app on the specified emulator or connected device. Follow any on-screen instructions to proceed.

## Project Structure

### 1. Screens Folder

- This folder contains all the screen components for different views in the app.
- Each screen is typically represented as a TypeScript file (e.g., `HomeScreen.tsx`, `ProfileScreen.tsx`).
- Screens generally handle the UI layout and business logic for a specific view.
- Common navigation libraries used include `@react-navigation/native` and `@react-navigation/stack` to manage transitions between screens.

### 2. Components Folder

- This folder contains reusable UI components that can be shared across different screens.
- Components could include things like buttons, cards, forms, etc.
- Using reusable components helps maintain consistency in the app's design and reduces redundancy in code.

### 3. Helpers Folder

- This folder contains utility functions and other helper modules that perform specific tasks such as formatting dates, making API calls, or manipulating data.
- Helpers help keep the code organized and improve code readability by separating concerns.

### 4. State (Recoil) Folder

- This folder contains state management logic, typically using the Recoil library.
- It includes atoms and selectors for managing global state across different parts of the app.
- Recoil provides a centralized way to manage state, making it easier to share state and state changes across different components.

### 5. Style Folder

- This folder contains shared styles and themes for the app.
- It can include global styles such as colors, fonts, and spacing, as well as reusable style objects.
- Organizing styles in a central location helps maintain consistency and allows for easier customization.

### 6. Routing Folder

- This folder contains the app's routing configuration and navigation logic.
- It includes navigator components, such as `StackNavigator` and `BottomTabNavigator`, that define the app's navigation flow.
- Routing is organized based on app state and user authentication, allowing for efficient transitions between screens.
- Use this folder to manage routes and navigation-related logic, ensuring the app's flow is consistent and user-friendly.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Code Organization**: Organize code logically by placing related files in the same folder. For example, keep all files related to a specific screen in the same folder.
- **TypeScript**: Leverage TypeScript's static typing to catch errors early and improve code readability and maintainability.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use consistent naming conventions for files, components, and state atoms/selectors to make code easier to understand and navigate.
- **Testing**: Consider adding tests for your components, screens, and state management logic to ensure code quality and reduce the risk of regressions.
- **Documentation**: Documenting your code and organizing it well will help other developers understand your codebase and collaborate more effectively.
